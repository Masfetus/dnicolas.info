Then, my IT education perfectly completed the theorical aspects I was lacking of to go one step further.",

Coordination between IT & Businness teams, data pipelines enablement, 3D data management, these activities lead to a new way of thinking production processes, as part of industry 4.0. I also contributed to the development of applications computing manufacturing data (MES, Thingworx applications).",
        "p5": "What about after work? Well, I had been playing table tennis for many years in France. This sport requires a lot of \"body coordination\" as well as mental and technical capabilities. In addition, I like gaming on PC and hiking in pleasant mountain environments. Lastly, this website will showcase some brick sets I have been working on. The passion of building architectural pieces up is real and gives satisfaction when assessing the progress throughout the work."
